* What format should I store stuff in?
I think I will stick with one file per song, because it keeps it human-readable. Also makes it
easier to grep through, because you don't have to worry about multiple tags being on one line or
something.

Now the question is, what should the data format be? My homemade key-value thing is probably not
going to cut it. I want to support:

- Integers, floats, strings
- Lists of values like genres

OK, I think YAML is the way to go. I think everything is already YAML so far.
