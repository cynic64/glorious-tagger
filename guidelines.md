# Quality (as judged by ME!)

9: Timeless classics: Everyday, Down to the Waterline, Cold, etc
8: Phenomenal but not perfect: Sweet Emotion, R U Mine?, Red Miso, Dancing Queen, Oliver Twist
7: Highly enjoyable never mind-blowing: My my my, Dancing Queen, Always More, Sundress
6: Mediocre with some good parts, Gold, Like a Stone, Holy Ghost
5: Mediocre but never bad, or bad with some really good parts: Too Soon, War Pigs

2-1: Mediocre german rap + famous stuff I don't really like

# Valence
9: Dancing Queen, most swing, Into Yesterday
7: Very positive but not like oozing with it at every seam. Born to Run, Sunshine of your Love, etc.

# Intensity
9: Cryptopsy, Everyday, Cold, Calabria
